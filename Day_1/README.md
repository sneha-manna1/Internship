Node.js Custom Module Practice Questions (Odd/Even, 
Prime, Array, Loops, Conditions) 
1. Create a custom module to check whether a given number is odd or even, and import 
it in another file. 
2. Create a module that prints all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a loop. Import 
and run it in app.js. 
3. Create a module that prints all odd numbers between 1 and 50 using a loop. Import 
and test it in another file. 
4. Create a function inside a custom module to check if a number is prime, then export 
and use it. 
5. Write a module that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100. Import it in another 
file and execute. 
6. Create a module to find the sum of all even numbers in an array. Import it into a 
separate file. 
7. Create a module to find the sum of all odd numbers in an array and export it for use 
in another file. 
8. Write a module that counts total even and odd numbers in an array. Import and test it 
in index.js. 
9. Create a custom module to find the largest number in an array and import it in 
another file. 
10. Write a module to find the smallest number in an array. Import and check with 
different inputs. 
11. Build a module to reverse the elements of an array using a loop and import it in 
main.js. 
12. Write a function inside a module to check if a number exists in an array. Import it and 
test in another file.

test it. 
14. Write a module that generates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers. Import and run it. 
15. Create a module to check if a number is part of the Fibonacci series. Import it in 
test.js. 
16. Write a module that calculates the sum of all numbers in an array using a loop. 
Import and test it.

run it. 
19. Create a module to count how many prime numbers exist in an array. Import and test 
it.

using built-in functions. Import and check. 
21. Write a module to check if a given string is a palindrome using a loop. Import and 
test.

file.

test it.

test it.
